    # write Python code to prompt the user to enter a year
    # ...then reads input from the user
    # ...then converts what was read into an integer
    # print out the final result and verify that it's an integer
    # your output should look something like this:

year = input("Enter a year:")
year = int(year)
print(f"Year entered is {year}")
print (type(year))
